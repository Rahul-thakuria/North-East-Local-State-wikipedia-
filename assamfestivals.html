    <div>
        <div><h1 class="heading assam5">1.Magh Bihu or Bhogali Bihu</h1> <img class="bihu h" src="images/magh.jpg" alt=""> <p class="p1" >The first day of Magh Bihu is known as Uruka or the Bihu Eve. The word Uruka is originally derived from the Deori-Chutia word Urukuwa which means "to end", signifying the end of the harvesting season as well the Pausha month.On this day, women folk get ready for the next day with food items like- Chira, Pitha, Laru, Curd. A feast is organised at night known as Bhuj.The day of the Bihu starts at early dawn by a post-harvesting ceremony called "Meji". In this, bonfires are burned in the fields and people pray to their ancestral gods for blessings.</div>
        <div><h1 class="heading assam5">2.Bohag Bihu or Rongali Bihu</h1> <img class="bihu" src="images/rongali.jpg" alt=""> 
            <p class="p2">Bohag Bihu is one of the most significant and important festivals in the Bihu calendar of Assam. It celebrates the commencement of harvesting season and is also regarded as the first day of the Assamese New Year. The significance of this festival is purely agricultural in nature. It is celebrated with great enthusiasm and joy throughout the state.Bohag Bihu is the most important Bihu festival among the three Bihu festivals celebrated in the state. The festival is celebrated for seven days during the month of Bohag (Baishakh Month) which falls somewhere in the middle of the month of April. Bohag Bihu is also known as Rongali Bihu in many parts of the state. The name Rongali is derived from the word “Rong”, which means happiness and celebration.</p>

        <div><h1 class="heading assam5">3.Kati Bihu or Kongali Bihu</h1> <img class="bihu" src="images/Kati.jpg" alt=""> 
            <p class="p3">Kongali Bihu or Kati Bihu as it is commonly known derives its name from the month of Kartik which is traditionally known as Kati. Unlike Bohag Bihu, Kati Bihu is not a flamboyant festival and the festivities are more sombre in nature. This Bihu is celebrated during the time of relocation of the rice sapling during the month of October. The granaries of the farmers usually remain empty during this time, hence it is known as Kongali (poor) Bihu.
